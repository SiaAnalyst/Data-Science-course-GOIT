# Hometask 6
The assignments are to be submitted in the form of one jupyter notebook.

## Task 1
In this assignment, you are to download this dataset. Here you will find 2 files - a two-dimensional dataset and a mnist dataset. For each of them, apply the K-means algorithm for clustering. Use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

## Task 2
Visualize the result of clustering. For the case of the mnist dataset, you will also need to use the PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of your data to a 2-dimensional version.
