# Hometask 5
In the homework assignment for this module, you will practice doing a test task for a job application. Based on the accelerometer data from your mobile phone, you need to classify what activity a person is doing: walking, standing, running, or climbing stairs. You can find the dataset here.

Use SVM algorithms and a random forest from the scikit-learn library. You can take accelerometer readings as characteristics, but to improve the results of the algorithms, you can first prepare our dataset and calculate time domain features. These features are described in more detail in this article.

Compare the results of both algorithms on different features and different models with each other.
