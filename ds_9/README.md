# Hometask 9

As a homework assignment, you are asked to create a neural network using Keras mechanisms that will classify products from the [fasion_mnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist) dataset.

You are to propose your own network architecture. The accuracy of the most naive but adequate neural network is approximately 91%. The accuracy of your model should be no lower than this. To achieve such values, you will need to experiment with network hyperparameters:

- number of layers;
- number of neurons;
- activation functions;
- number of epochs;
- the size of the batch.
